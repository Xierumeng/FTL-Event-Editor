# Plan 2020

## 2020-0104 Winter - Phase 1: Alpha

Summary: The user may import XML files in order to simulate and test their events (created outside of this program).

### Import

The interface between TinyXML-2's Document Object Model and the internal program's data structure shall be started.
This interface involves converting the DOM to internal data structure. Export will come later.

### Test/Simulate

Loaded data will be able to be played through similarly to jumping to a new beacon in the game itself.
The user will be presented with additional data (such as name calls) to make debugging easier.

### UX

The user interface consists solely of the console, with text command inputs.

## 2020-0508 Spring/Summer - Phase 2: Alpha

Summary: The remaining program functionality shall be implemented, making it complete.

### Export

The interface between TinyXML-2's Document Object Model and the internal program's data structure shall be completed.
The internal data structure will be able to be converted to the DOM.
This is the first priority in order to discover any bugs with the export process itself.

### Create/Modify/Delete

The user may create, modify, and delete events within the program.

### UX

The user interface shall be created using Qt.
Preliminary buttons and fields shall make the user experience more pleasant than the console. 

## 2020-0912 Fall/Autumn - Phase 3: Beta

Summary: Given feedback, bugs will be squashed and the user experience improved.

### UX

The user interface will be improved given feedback from users.
